Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.
Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.

Why is data visualization important?
Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports.
Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner – and you can experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.

Data visualization can also:
· Identify areas that need attention or improvement.

· Clarify which factors influence customer behavior.

· Help you understand which products to place where.

· Predict sales volumes.



We can use programming languages like python, R for visulaizing the data but there are also automated tools like PowerBI, ECharts, Tableau, Vega,.... for visualizing the data.

Python provides numerous methods for data visualization. Various Python libraries can be used for data visualization, such as Pandas, Seaborn, Bokeh, Pygal, and Ploty.
Python Pandas is the simplest method for basic plotting.
Python Seaborn is great for creating visually appealing statistical charts that include color.
Python Bokeh works great for more complicated visualizations, especially for web-based interactive presentations.
Python Pygal works well for generating vector and interactive files.
